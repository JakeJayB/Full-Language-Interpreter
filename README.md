# Full-Language-Interpreter

Full Language Interpreter in Python
This is a full language interpreter made with Python that supports assignment, if-statement, and while-loops. The interpreter allows you to write and execute programs written in a custom programming language.

Features
Assignment: Assign values to variables using the = operator.
If-Statements: Use if statements to execute code conditionally.
While-Loops: Use while loops to execute code repeatedly while a condition is true.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the interpreter using python interpreter.py.
Usage
The interpreter supports a custom programming language with the following syntax:

Assignment
To assign a value to a variable, use the following syntax:

makefile
Copy code
variable_name = value
For example:

makefile
Copy code
x = 5
If-Statements
To execute code conditionally, use the following syntax:

vbnet
Copy code
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true.
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is false.
For example:

bash
Copy code
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
While-Loops
To execute code repeatedly while a condition is true, use the following syntax:

vbnet
Copy code
while condition:
    # Code to execute while condition is true.
For example:

bash
Copy code
x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(x)
    x += 1
